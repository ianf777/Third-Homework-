# Homework-03
Third homework assignment, for this assignment we were tasked to write JS capable of generating a password. The goal was to make a series of prompts pop up asking questions about
the criteria of the password. The password was not to be less than 8 characters and no more than 120. 
The script is succesful if when all prompts are completed, the password is generated to the field based upon the criteria the user has selected.
